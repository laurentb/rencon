rencon is a simple, safe tool able to rename files based on their content.

Example usage:
    rencon -m 'r_${hash}.${ext}' *.jpg

It will rename all .jpg files with a hash based on their content, and add "r_"
to distinguish them.

The default mask is ${hash}.${ext}. The hash used is SHA1.

For more information, run rencon -h.

It does not erase existing files.
While it can be used in that way it does not aim to do file deduplication.
